- [ ] warn when latest file is updated after execution, and give a support to re-run it
- [ ] give support to remove migration files which have not been run, in case of merge conflicts
    - this can be done only for latest files
- [ ] check if migration table exists, and run if not, refer to that blog
- [ ] what if we don't merge code to master and deploy to uat? then there could be conflicts related to that
    - [ ] have migration and fallbacks

- [ ] make matchers optional and then based on that see if any thing is missing
